          <p>I'm learning a lot. Now it's 12AM and I just finished redesigning this website. I'm two and a half hours in Code
            Monkey's 10 hours Unity course and I'm loving it so far. Follow your dreams, it is the best thing you can do - and
            also the most frightening.</p>

          <p>Studying every single day to become a better programmer. I've put a semi-hiatus in my blog to focus on my career, joined six or seven game development Discord servers, and watched a bunch of
          tutorials (and applying the knowledge) about Unity, C# and clean code in general.</p>
          <p>There's a video I think every programmer, junior and middle, should watch. Link below.</p>

        <p>You arrived at strange times, mate. Strange times indeed. ðŸ¦œ</p>
        <p>What happened? Well... Let's just say...</p>
        <p>
          ...I really liked designing web sites, using React and Angular as well. I used TypeScript and I've just finished my
          first real project. Things were going pretty well, no big frustration or anything. The problem arrived when
          I had some time to think about my dreams and my goals in life. Front-end development doesn't use the same tools as
          game development, so I realized if I wanted to make my dream game in the future, I would have to hone different
          skills, some contradicting with each other. There's no real synergy amongst gamedev and webdev. After talking with my
          family I decided to switch gears and go directly towards my life goals, instead of taking sharp and inconsistent
          turns. Now there will be synergy amongst my hobby and my job, since they require the same skills and tools.
        </p>
        <p>Since I'm no longer applying for React jobs, I can create minimalistic static web pages now, just like 1990.</p>
        <p>Enjoy the lack of JavaScript.</p>
