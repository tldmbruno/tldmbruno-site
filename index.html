      <p>You arrived at strange times, mate. Strange times indeed. ü¶ú</p>
      <p>What happened? Well... Let's just say...</p>
      <p>
        ...I really liked designing web sites, using React and Angular as well. I used TypeScript and I've just finished my
        first real project. Things were going pretty well, no big frustration or anything. The problem arrived when
        I had some time to think about my dreams and my goals in life. Front-end development doesn't use the same tools as
        game development, so I realized if I wanted to make my dream game in the future, I would have to hone different
        skills, some contradicting with each other. There's no real synergy amongst gamedev and webdev. After talking with my
        family I decided to switch gears and go directly towards my life goals, instead of taking sharp and inconsistent
        turns. Now there will be synergy amongst my hobby and my job, since they require the same skills and tools.
      </p>
      <p>Since I'm no longer applying for React jobs, I can create minimalistic static web pages now, just like 1990.</p>
      <p>Enjoy the lack of JavaScript.</p>
