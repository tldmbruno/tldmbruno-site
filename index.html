        <p>
          You will want to learn three things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The engine you will use: 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7d8uYw59jk">Godot</a>
            for most games, 
            <a href="#unreal-tutorial">Unreal</a>
            for hyper realistic games.
          </li>

             and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zLwa4bztWs">intriguing</a> game
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Yet, start small. Make micro games, that take 5 minutes to finish and ask your friends to play. 
          Hear their feedback and improve upon it. And never, ever, give up. 
          Go gradually making greater and more polished games. 
          Be ambitious, dream big, one step at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't LOVE making games, you WILL quit. 
          Game programming is torture to people who don't enjoy. 
          When someone tells me he/she will start making games, 
          I fully expect them to quit, until they prove me they love making games (including debugging).

          <p>
            An opensource tech-demo, mixing Ghost Runner and Devil May Cry
            together in a fast paced, first person melee combat. Designed to test
            my skills as a game developer, specifically as Gameplay Engineer.
            Developed using the Unreal Engine 4.27, and it uses Blueprint and C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past I've made many Godot games, and one Unity game. I've
            published them all in my Itch.io page.

          <h1>Where can I learn Unreal?</h1>
          <p>
            Although it is difficult to find useful and reliable Unreal Engine
            content on Youtube, there are some channels and websites which produce
            amazing learning content. The Unreal channel itself is maybe the best
            place to learn the fundamentals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am only providing the best guides, since your game development
            journey will differ from mine.

          Most people doesn't want to learn the truth. The few who do in fact want
          to, will completely refuse the truth if presented in front of their
          faces*. So, to filter those who "kinda want to know the truth" from the
          fewer who want the truth, I've hidden a link which leads to a Brazilian
          Youtube channel with the initials "D.P.". They teach everything:
          finances, geography, health... and many things I prefer to currently
          ommit.
        </p>
        <p>* An example: "We become what we think about".</p>
        <p>
          There is also Dr. Lair Ribeiro, maybe the best doctor of the 21th
          century. Although many of his teachings are considered polemic, it is
          way easier to believe than what "DP" teaches.

          Q: "Why just Brazilian-portuguese content?" ; A: Because Brazil has the
          most abundant and diverse fauna and flora in the world - and some other
          reasons.

        <h1>ðŸŽ² Tabletop RPGs: Play it properly </h1>
        <p>
          I've played Tabletop RPGs for nine years. My players and I consider
          myself an excelent Game Master. Here is the secret for great games (nine
          years of experience, condensed within an small article), you accepting
          the information or not:

              >3rd Secret you should know</a
            >
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>All your system needs are the following rules and NOTHING ELSE:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "What dice do we roll (and what are the probabilities of success for
            easy, normal and hard tasks)"
          </li>
          <li>
            "How many hits can a adult human take before they die? (and how does
            armor interfere with this)"
          </li>
          <li>
            "After the combat starts, in what order the combatants attack? (Do
            everyone attack at once, or is it sequential, going around the table?)
          </li>
          <li>
            "For mystical inclined characters, they should roll twice. The first
            is to know if the spell is successful. The second is to know how
            successful it is."
          </li>
          <li>
            "What is the procedure to create a character and start playing? The
            process MUST NOT take more than 3 minutes. Players can flesh out their
            backstories, and reveal it, as the game goes."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That's it. Classes, item lists, loot tables, spell lists, and everything
          else MUST BE KEPT AWAY from the game rules. They are bound to your game
          WORLD, not your game RULES. Do never confuse the two. I've seen too many
          great Game Masters waste their precious years on game rules because they
          made the mistake to merge game-world and game-rules together. I've also
          made that mistake in the past.
